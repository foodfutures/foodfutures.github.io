										<h2>Which meals would this impact and how would it be enforced?</h2>
										<p>Food funding is decentralized. Media Lab funds are spent on meals across four categories: 
											<ol>
												<li>All-lab lunches, Lean Box, and other vending machines (purchased by facilities)</li>
												<li>Research group and class lunches (purchased by groups and professors)</li>
												<li>Individual purchases (e.g. reimbursed dinners from travel)</li>
												<li>Member meetings and other special events</li>
											</ol>
										</p>
										<p>
											Meatless food expenditures would not be formally enforced. 
											This is a proposal for the community to agree to act upon a golden rule.
										</p>

											<h2>Does this mean I can't eat meat in the Media Lab?</h2>
										<p>No! This proposal is only about food purchased with Media Lab funds. 
											Folks are of course free to eat or bring whatever they want.
										</p>

										<h2>Is this FoodCam 2.0?</h2>
										<p>
											FoodCam is a Media Lab technology that reduces food waste: 
											Folks leave left over catering in the FoodCam area, push the FoodCam button, and a notification with images of the food are sent out so that others can come and enjoy what would otherwise be wasted.
											FoodCam has created visible artifacts of the lab's values of prototyping and communal effort. 
										</p>

										<p>
											This proposal is a FoodCam 2.0: turning the camera back onto ourselves to further prototype our values as climate action. 
											Let's hold ourselves accountable to our sustainability goals!
										</p>
										<h2>Will this be annoying in practice?</h2>
										<p>
												No! To reduce the burden on those ordering food, we are crowdsourcing a list of excellent vegetarian food options in the Cambridge area.
												Add your favorite options or view others.

											<h2> Who made this website, and how did this proposal come to be?</h2>
											<p>This proposal started out as a pitch at the <a href = "https://thefestival.media.mit.edu/">2021 Festival of Learning</a>, where Pattie Maes led a "Crazy Ideas Pitch" session. The theme of the session was that every pitch had to start with "Wouldn't it be awesome if…". This pitch was <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MlwW5LZCnKecBeKHYB4-w-PV5rZzdrXmYSlfbMP-tpI/edit?usp=sharing">"Wouldn’t it be awesome if... The Media Lab represented its environmental values with the food it pays for?".</a> The pitch got a lot of support from both students and faculty attending the session and since then we've talked to administration about how to go about exploring a potential implementation.  We know this can only happen as a golden rule supported by community consensus, which is why we're starting with a survey and a conversation.</p>

<p>This website and proposal were drafted by Alex Berke, Ziv Epstein, and Caroline Jaffe. We'd love to include more people with many perspectives in the creation of this proposal, so whether you have concerns to share or ways you want to lend a hand, please reach out to foodfutures@mit.edu. 
</p>

										<h2>What are next the steps?</h2>
										<p>
											This is a start of a conversation to gather feedback from the broad Media Lab community. 
											Please fill out the survey so that we can gauge interest in this proposal and understand and respond to concerns or suggestions.
											We will make the survey results available during the Festival of Learning to provide scaffolding for more conversation.
