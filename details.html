											Globally, food accounts for over 25% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [<a href = "https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216">1</a>,<a href = "https://ourworldindata.org/food-ghg-emissions">2</a>]. 
											And among food production, meat takes up the lion share of emissions. 
											Emissions from animal-based foods are twice that of plant-based foods [<a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00358-x.epdf">3</a>].

										<h2>How it plays out at the Media Lab</h2>
										<p>In summer 2020, in collaboration with HBS environmental metrics startup <a href = "https://www.metric-esg.com/">Metric</a>, we conducted a sustainability analysis of the Media Lab. We found that the Lab’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (ie all the emissions related to heating, cooling and powering the Lab’s operations) were ~2800 Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) for 2019. </p> 

										<p>To calculate emissions related to food purchasing, we looked at the Lab’s overall food expenditures, estimated the tons of food represented by that number based on local food prices, and calculated the emissions represented by those tons of food based on average meat consumption. 
											Through this process, 
											we estimated that the food purchased by the Media Lab was responsible for ~6500 MTCO2e. 
											6500 MTCO2e is roughly equal to the emissions produced by ~1400 cars being driven for a full year.
										</p>
										<p>
											The 6500 MTCO2e from food expenditures is more than 2x the emissions coming from our electricity and HVAC systems.
											Since meat dwarfs dairy in emissions impact, this suggests meat is among the largest contributors to the Media Lab's GHG emissions, rivaling both electricity and HVAC.

											<h2>An opportunity for change</h2>
											<p>
												Meat is a large contributor to the Media Lab's GHG emissions and we can do something about it.
												<br/>
												Food Futures is a climate action proposal to eliminate meat from Media Lab food expenditures.
												<br/>
												This is an opportunity for the Media Lab to show climate leadership and innovation in our food purchasing practices.
												This is an opportunity to transform climate research into action. 
											</p>
